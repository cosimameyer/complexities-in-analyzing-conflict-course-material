# complexities-in-analyzing-conflict-course-material
This repository contains teaching material that I used to teach the class ["Complexities in Analyzing Conflicts: Data Wrangling and Data Management in R" (Fall 2019)](https://cosimameyer.github.io/files/complexities2019.pdf) at the University of Mannheim. It offers both an introduction to R/RStudio and showcases common problems that arise when dealing with complex data structures in conflict research.
